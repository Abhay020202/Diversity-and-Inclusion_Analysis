## Project Overview
This Power BI dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of diversity and inclusion metrics for our telecom client. It addresses the challenges faced in achieving gender balance at the executive management level and includes actionable insights for hiring, promotions, turnover, and performance evaluations. With clear and self-explanatory visualizations, the dashboard equips Human Resources with data-driven tools to implement meaningful change.

## Problem Statement
- **Challenges in Gender Balance**: The telecom client is struggling to improve gender diversity at the executive level despite dedicated efforts.
- **The Importance of Diversity**:
   - Diversity and inclusion are essential business imperatives in today's heterogeneous world. Teams need to feel valued and appreciated for organizations to succeed.
   - Achieving this involves overcoming practical challenges like bias in hiring, promotions, and performance evaluations.
- **Need for Analytics**:
   - Previous analyses using Excel have failed to deliver actionable results, leaving HR teams without clear direction.
   - Proactive data visualizations and measurable KPIs are required to uncover hidden trends and drive meaningful progress.

## Dataset Description
The dashboard is built using metrics related to hiring, promotions, turnover, and performance. Key dataset columns include:
- **Gender**: Number of male and female employees.
- **Leavers**: Total employees who left during FY21.
- **Promotions**:
   - Total promotions (FY21).
   - Percentage of women promoted compared to men.
- **Hires**:
   - Percentage of male and female hires.
   - Hiring breakdown across job levels.
- **Turnover Rates**: Percentage of employees leaving by gender.
- **Performance Ratings**: Average ratings segmented by gender.

## Key Insights
### 1. Hiring and Workforce Composition:
- **Gender Representation**: Women account for only 15.79% of executive positions, highlighting significant underrepresentation.
- **Recruitment Bias**: Male candidates dominate hiring for leadership roles, with limited focus on gender-neutral recruitment strategies.

### 2. Promotion Patterns:
- **Women Promotions**: Women are consistently underrepresented in promotions, particularly at executive and managerial levels.
- **Promotion Challenges**: The absence of mentorship programs for female employees limits upward mobility.

### 3. Turnover Analysis:
- **Retention Challenges**: Turnover rates among women are disproportionately high, particularly at senior levels, suggesting dissatisfaction with work-life balance policies.

### 4. Performance Trends:
- **Evaluation Bias**: Performance ratings are nearly identical for men (2.41) and women (2.42), indicating fairness in evaluation but potential bias at higher leadership levels.

## Recommendations
### 1. Revamp Hiring Strategies:
- **Expand Talent Pools**: Target women-specific networks and create gender-neutral job postings to eliminate bias in recruitment.
- **Diversity-Focused Hiring Panels**: Involve diverse hiring committees to ensure fairness during decision-making.

### 2. Promote Women Leadership:
- **Mentorship Programs**: Establish leadership development initiatives for women to prepare them for executive positions.
- **Track Promotion Metrics**: Use dashboards to monitor promotion fairness and ensure equal opportunities across departments.

### 3. Retain Women Employees:
- **Family-Friendly Policies**: Introduce flexible working hours, remote work options, and childcare support to improve retention rates.
- **Exit Analysis**: Conduct thorough exit interviews to identify and address pain points driving turnover.

### 4. Reduce Evaluation Bias:
- **Standardized Performance Reviews**: Implement clear guidelines for evaluating employees to mitigate unconscious bias.
- **Bias Awareness Training**: Train managers to ensure performance reviews are equitable and constructive.

### 5. Define Diversity Goals:
- **Measurable Objectives**: Set specific targets for gender balance at executive levels (e.g., increase women executives by 10% in the next fiscal year).
- **Periodic Monitoring**: Use dashboards to track progress and make adjustments based on real-time insights.
